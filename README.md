## FAQ

 - **why Bash? (Python|Ruby|Rust|OCaml|COBOL|FORTRAN) would have been so much (harder|better|faster|stronger)?**:  
   Mainly because of compatibility. I expect this tool to be useful in weird server/docker deployments where ability to install dependencies is limited. Bash is available by default in a lot of such environments.
